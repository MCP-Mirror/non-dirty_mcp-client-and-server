Epic 1: Basic MCP Server Implementation

[ ] Story 1.1: Implement Minimal MCP Server (Mock)

[√] [T] Task 1.1.1: Write test for `initialize` request.
    *   Task Name: Write test for `initialize` request
    *   Task State: Completed
    *   Task Assignee: User
    *   Task Description:
        *   Job To Be Done: As a developer, when I implement the `initialize` request handler, I want to have a test in place to verify its behavior, so that I can ensure it conforms to the MCP specification.
        *   Paragraph Description: Write a unit test that sends an `initialize` request to the mock server and asserts that the response conforms to the MCP spec, including the `capabilities`, `protocolVersion`, and `serverInfo` fields. The test should check for successful initialization and proper handling of invalid requests (e.g., missing required parameters).
    *   Success Criteria:
        *   Given: A mock MCP server and a test framework are set up.
        *   When: The test for the `initialize` request is executed.
        *   Then: The test passes if the mock server responds correctly to valid and invalid initialize requests, according to the MCP spec. The test should specifically check for the presence and correctness of `capabilities`, `protocolVersion`, and `serverInfo` fields in the response. It should also handle and verify the server's response to invalid requests.

[√] Task 1.1.2: Implement `initialize` request handler.
    *   Task Name: Implement `initialize` request handler
    *   Task State: Completed
    *   Task Assignee: User
    *   Task Description:
        *   Job To Be Done: As a user, when I start an MCP client, I need the server to respond to the initialize request correctly, to establish the connection and negotiate capabilities according to the MCP spec.
        *   Paragraph Description: Implement the server-side handler for the `initialize` request. This handler should return a valid `InitializeResult` according to the MCP specification, including the server's capabilities, protocol version, and server info. For a mock server, these can be placeholder values.
    *   Success Criteria:
        *   Given: An MCP client sends a valid `initialize` request to the server.
        *   When: The server receives the request.
        *   Then: The server responds with a valid `InitializeResult` as defined in the MCP specification. The response should include the server's capabilities, protocol version, and server info.

    *   Success Criteria:
        *   Given: A mock MCP server and a test framework are set up.
        *   When: The test for the `ping` request is executed.
        *   Then: The test passes if the server responds to the `ping` request with a valid (empty) response, indicating it is reachable and responsive. It should also correctly handle any invalid request parameters and return appropriate error responses, if applicable (as defined by the MCP spec).

        *   Paragraph Description: Implement the `ping` request handler on the server. This handler should respond with an empty result, acknowledging receipt of the ping.
    *   Success Criteria:
        *   Given: An MCP client sends a valid `ping` request.
        *   When: The server receives the `ping` request.

        *   Paragraph Description:  Write a test that sends a `resources/list` request and verifies that the server returns an empty list of resources. This test covers the case where the server is functioning correctly but has no resources to report.
    *   Success Criteria:
        *   Given: The mock server has no resources defined.
        *   When: A client sends a `resources/list` request.
        *   Then: The server responds with a valid MCP response containing an empty list of resources (`resources` field should be an empty array).

    * Task Description:
        * Job To Be Done: As a server developer, when receiving a `prompts/list` request, I want to provide a valid response indicating an empty list if no prompts are available, so the client can gracefully handle the lack of prompts.
        * Paragraph Description: Implement the `prompts/list` request handler on the server to return a valid (but empty) list when no prompts are available, adhering to the MCP specification for a consistent client experience.
    * Success Criteria:
        * Given: A running mock server without any defined prompts.
        * When: A valid `prompts/list` request is received by the server.

        *   Paragraph Description:  Implement a default error handler on the server. This should intercept any requests for methods that aren't explicitly handled by the mock server and return an "unsupported method" MCP error response. This ensures the server always responds in a well-defined manner, even to invalid requests.
    *   Success Criteria:
        *   Given: The mock server receives a request with an unsupported method.
        *   When: The request is processed.
        *   Then: The server responds with a valid MCP error response indicating that the method is not supported. The error message and code should comply with the MCP spec.
