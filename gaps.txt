Gaps Analysis for Tasks 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 (Updated 2024-12-09)

Task 1.1.1 - Write test for `initialize` request
Current Implementation:
✓ Test verifies presence of required fields (capabilities, protocolVersion, serverInfo)
✓ Test checks response structure for valid requests
✓ Test verifies specific field values (e.g., server name)
✓ Added test cases for invalid requests
✓ Added test cases for missing required parameters
✓ Added test cases for malformed request data

Gaps:
✓ All gaps have been addressed

Task 1.1.2 - Implement `initialize` request handler
Current Implementation:
✓ Returns valid InitializeResult structure
✓ Includes all required fields
✓ Uses correct data types for each field
✓ Added validation of incoming request parameters
✓ Added error handling for invalid requests
✓ Added support for optional initialization options
✓ Added type checking of input parameters

Gaps:
✓ All gaps have been addressed

Summary of Completed Work:
1. Added comprehensive test coverage:
   - Basic initialization
   - Initialization with valid options
   - Invalid option types (non-dict capabilities, non-string protocol version)
   - Malformed input data (non-dict inputs, unexpected keys)

2. Enhanced handler implementation:
   - Added input validation for all parameters
   - Added proper error handling with descriptive messages
   - Added type checking for all input fields
   - Added validation of optional parameters
   - Added comprehensive docstring with Args, Returns, and Raises sections

All success criteria for both tasks have been met. The implementation now handles both valid and invalid cases appropriately, with proper error handling and validation.
